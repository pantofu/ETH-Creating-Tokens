# ETH-Creating-Tokens
This sample program showcases the simple creation of a token and its functionalities.
## Description
As required, it has the following steps from declaring public variables, mapping, adding a mint function, and the burn function. This program shows you the basics of solidity programming and serves as a sample for minting and burning tokens within Ethereum.

## Getting Started

### Installing
* The following code can be applied on the https://remix.ethereum.org/ to see how it works.

### Executing program
* To start things off, you can start with a new workspace by clicking "Start Coding"

* After pasting the code, you might run into an error by default. This is because of a different compiler version, as the image shows.

* To fix this, you can change the compiler version through the solidity compiler.

* Once the error is gone, you can start compiling the file under the Solidity Compiler.

* Try deploying it under the Deploy & Run Transactions.

* If it was successful, it should show up in the terminal, and the Deployed/Unpinned Contracts.

* You can start playing around with it by copying the account.

* Try putting it in the address field of the mint function here. You can also put your desired value and then press the transact button. If things went through properly, the result should show up for total supply and balances.

* The same process can be applied to the burn function.

* Doing so will reduce the number of total supply and our current balance.
